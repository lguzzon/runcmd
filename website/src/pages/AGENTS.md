# website/src/pages

Landing and documentation pages for the RunCmd project built with Astro, providing the public-facing website with version-aware hero sections, feature showcases, and embedded usage guides.

## Contents

[index.astro](./index.astro) — Main landing page with hero, features grid (Cross-Platform, Zero Config, Robust & Safe, Modern Tooling), and quickstart commands. Reads version from `version.txt` at build time.

[docs.astro](./docs.astro) — Full documentation site with sections for overview, installation (Unix/Windows), usage, debugging, environment variables, runners, git-flow, and resources.

## Stack

Astro SSG pages with Tailwind CSS for styling. Build-time constants (`basePath`, `normalizedBase`, `version`, `githubUrl`, `scriptHref`) resolved from `Astro.site?.pathname` and `version.txt`. Both pages use `BaseLayout.astro` wrapper and `Nav.astro` component.

## Build-Time Configuration

| Constant | Source |
|----------|--------|
| `basePath` | `Astro.site?.pathname ?? '/runcmd/'` |
| `normalizedBase` | `basePath.replace(/\/$/, '')` |
| `version` | `../../../version.txt` (defaults to `'1.0.0'`) |
| `githubUrl` | `'https://github.com/lguzzon/runcmd'` |
| `scriptHref` | `${normalizedBase}/runcmd.sh` |

## Patterns

Both pages follow identical patterns: fs-promises for file reads at build time, dynamic year via `new Date().getFullYear()`, dark mode via `dark:` Tailwind classes, responsive grids with `md:grid-cols-*` breakpoints.

## Behavioral Contracts

Both files use identical regex for trailing slash normalization: `/\/$/` (replaces with empty string).

## Import Map

```text
fs: node:fs/promises
BaseLayout: ../layouts/BaseLayout.astro
Nav: ../components/Nav.astro
